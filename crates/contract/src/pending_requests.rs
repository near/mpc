//! Storage and bookkeeping for pending request fan-out.
//!
//! Each pending-request map stores a `Vec<YieldIndex>` so that duplicate
//! submissions of the same request key queue up and all receive the same MPC
//! response. This module owns:
//!
//! * the cap on how many yields may be queued for a single key,
//! * the queue mutations (`push`, FIFO pop, drain),
//! * the read/write policy on the fan-out map: `push_pending_yield` appends,
//!   `resolve_yields_for` drains the full queue on a response, and
//!   `pop_oldest_pending_yield` removes the head entry on a timeout.
//!
//! Callers in `lib.rs` go through these helpers rather than touching the maps
//! directly, so the queue policy lives in one place.
