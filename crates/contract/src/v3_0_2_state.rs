//! ## Overview
//! This module stores the previous contract state—the one you want to migrate from.
//! The goal is to describe the data layout _exactly_ as it existed before.
//!
//! ## Guideline
//! In theory, you could copy-paste every struct from the specific commit you're migrating from.
//! However, this approach (a) requires manual effort from a developer and (b) increases the binary size.
//! A better approach: only copy the structures that have changed and import the rest from the existing codebase.
