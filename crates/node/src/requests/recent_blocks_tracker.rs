/// Tracks the topology of the recent blocks, using the blocks given by the indexer.
///
/// This class provides two important functionalities:
///  - For any given block, it classifies it into one of the categories in `CheckBlockResult`.
///    See the documentation of that enum for the classifications.
///  - Converts a stream of optimistic blocks from the indexer into a stream of finalized
///    blocks. The content of each block in the finalized stream is specified via the `T`
///    type parameter.
///
/// We have certain expectations of the order of blocks that come from the indexer.
/// First, let's define a partial order for blocks. For any two blocks A and B:
///  - If A is a strict ancestor of B then A < B;
///  - If B is a strict ancestor of A then B < A;
///  - If A is the same block as B then A = B;
///  - Otherwise, A and B are not ordered.
///
/// We expect that the blocks given by the indexer:
///  - Respects partial order. That is, if A is given before B, it must not happen that A > B.
///  - Furthermore, if A < B and B < C, and both A and C are given, then B must also be given.
///    In other words there should not be any gaps.
///
/// That being said, the following is fair game:
///  - The indexer gives blocks of different forks in any order, i.e. it can give a block of
///    height 12 and then another block of height 10 that belongs to a different fork.
///  - The indexer, upon startup, may start giving blocks from any position in the blockchain,
///    including giving blocks from multiple forks without giving us any common parents.
///
/// Given these expectations, we provide the aforementioned functionalities by tracking the
/// following:
///  - We keep a fixed-sized window of recent blocks, i.e. all blocks with height >= H - W + 1,
///    where H is the height of the latest block we have *heard of*, and W is the window size.
///    - "Heard of" means the maximum of what we have seen, as well as what others have told us.
///  - We keep track of the canonical chain as well as the final chain.
///
/// Despite the assumptions we make on the indexer's behavior, this class guarantees not to panic
/// even if the indexer violates these assumptions in arbitrary ways.
///
/// Note: The use of Arc is a little unfortunate. Logically we only need Rc, but this code needs
/// to work in futures, and Rc is not Send. So we use Arc instead.
