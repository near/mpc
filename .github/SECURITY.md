# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

NEAR values the independent security research community and believes that
responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security
and privacy of all our users.

Please do NOT raise a GitHub Issue to report a security vulnerability. If you
believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report to
<security@nearone.org>, preferably with a proof of concept. We ask that you
do not use other channels or contact project contributors directly.

Non-vulnerability-related security issues, such as new ideas for security
features, are welcome on GitHub Issues.

## Security-Related Information

We will provide security-related information such as a threat model,
considerations for secure use, or any known security issues in our
documentation. Please note that labs and sample code are intended to demonstrate
a concept and may need to be sufficiently hardened for production use.
