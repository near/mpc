"""
Tests that signature/ckd requests are still processed while performing key resharing, when
the new threshold is higher than available nodes from the previous running state.

Test scenario:
    1. Start with:
        a. 2 nodes
        b. threshold set to 2.
        c. 1 domain for ECDSA and EdDSA each.
    2. Add 2 more, and increase threshold to 4 participants to start a key resharing.
    3. While in resharing, kill one node such that the nodes are stuck in resharing.
    4. Send a signature/ckd request to assert that it is processed while the network is in resharing state,
        even if less nodes than the new treshold are online.
