# Deploy and Upgrade an MPC Node on dstack

The launcher is a single Python script: [launcher.py](launcher.py)

This is a secure launcher script for initializing and attesting a Docker-based MPC node.  
It is designed to run inside a TEE-enabled environment (e.g., Intel TDX) to add and ensures the integrity and trustworthiness of the image before launching it.


## üîê Features

- Pull an MPC docker image.
- Compares the MPC image digest against expected values
- Extends RTMR3 with the verified image digest
- prints remote attestation and quote generation infomation to log
- Starts the MPC node container with secure mount and network settings

##  usage
The launcher script is designed to run inside a confidential TDX VM managed by DStack VMM.

launcher-docker-compose.yaml ‚Äî Docker Compose file used to start the launcher and supporting containers.
config.txt ‚Äî File containing trusted environment variables used by the launcher and MPC node.
It should be uploaded to: /tapp/.host-shared/.user-config

## üß© Environment Variables

- `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1`: Must be enabled
- `DEFAULT_IMAGE_DIGEST`: The expected hash of the Docker image (e.g., `sha256:...`)

## üìÅ File Locations

- `/tapp/.host-shared/.user-config`: Optional `.env` file for overriding defaults
- `/mnt/shared/image-digest`: Optional override of image digest (written by external components)
- `/var/run/dstack.sock`: Unix socket used to communicate with `dstack`

## üîß Configuration (via user-config)

The launcher supports the following environment variables via `/tapp/.host-shared/.user-config`:

LAUNCHER_IMAGE_NAME=nearone/mpc-node-gcp
LAUNCHER_IMAGE_TAGS=latest
LAUNCHER_REGISTRY=registry.hub.docker.com


## Reproducible builds
from: tee_launcher folder run:
docker build -t barakeinavnear/launcher:latest -f development/Dockerfile.launcher .

- [Makefile](Makefile): use this to build the mpc binary in a reproducible manner
- [deployment/Dockerfile-gcp](deployment/Dockerfile-gcp) Dockerfile with all dependencies pinned to specific versions, e.g., other Dockerfile via sha256 digests and Linux distribution packages via explicit version strings
- [deployment/build-image.sh](deployment/build-image.sh) drives the build process

For example, I ran `deployment/build-image.sh` on the git commit [ef3f1e7...](https://github.com/Near-One/mpc/commit/ef3f1e7f862d447de60e91d32dadf68696eb6a58). The resulting Docker image digest was

```
sha256:dcbd3b8c8ae35d2ba63b25d6b617ce8b7faabb0af96ffa2e35b08a50258ebfa4
```

and the MPC binary digest was

```
5dd1a80f842d08753184334466e97d55e5caa3dbcd93af27097d11e926d7f823
```

The respective commands to find either are

```
docker image inspect mpc-node-gcp:latest | jq '.[0].Id'
```

Note, the image digest used with `docker run` is the output of the `docker image inspect ...` command.

```
docker run --rm dcbd3b8c8ae35d2ba63b25d6b617ce8b7faabb0af96ffa2e35b08a50258ebfa4 cat /app/mpc-node | sha256sum
```

Opens: write a script utilizing `vmm-cli.py` from dstack to deploy an mpc node

- Artifacts to deploy a node
    - Scripts to a) reproducibly build the mpc binary and b) reproducibly build a docker image containing the mpc binary
- Actual upgrade procedure
    - Write new image hash to /mnt/shared/image-digest
    - Shut down cvm
    - Amend LAUNCHER_IMAGE_TAGS if necessary; can be done from host by editing ./meta-dstack/build/run/*/shared/.user-config
    -
