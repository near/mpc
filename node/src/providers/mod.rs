//! This module abstracts the Signature Schema,
//! i.e., we might want to use ECDSA over the Secp256k1 curve, EdDSA over Ed25519, or something else.
//! `SignatureProvider` exposes an interface for such add-ons. Alongside it, helper functions
//! (like `RegisterMpcTask`) are exposed, which somewhat guarantees that if the code compiles,
//! you don’t need to add anything more internally for it to work.
//!
//! As a reference, check the existing implementations.
